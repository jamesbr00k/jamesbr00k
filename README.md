# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James, a full-time student, and a avid developer in my free time. When I'm not immersed in my studies, I work part-time at **Just Paper Bags** where I wear multiple hats - from managing social media to managing their website.

## My Role at Just Paper Bags

Additionally, I drive the company's online presence as the Social Media Manager, crafting posts that resonate with our audience and maintaing a consistant brand image.

## Technologies & Tools
- Swift (specialisation in development for apple platforms)
- C# (what i use for my course work)
- Wordpress (what i used to create the JPB site and many other sites for clients)
- Photoshop and Illustrator (While im no master I am fluent with both softwear and can create beautifull images and icons)
